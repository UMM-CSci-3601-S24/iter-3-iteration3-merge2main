### Roadmap for the future of Scav-a-snap
## Known Issues
* Some phone models are not compatible with the photo submissions.  Submission appears as a black square.
* Some submitted photos appear rotated.
* If the host ends a hunt, navigates to the url of that in-progress hunt, photos can still be deleted, and the photos are removed from the ended hunt page.
* If multiple hunters are on the same team, other teammates photos are not updated live, a refresh is required.
* If the host ends a hunt, the hunter is not taken to the 'Your hunt has ended page'.
* If the host deletes a team's photo submission during a in-progress hunt, the photo is still visible for the hunter.  If the hunter tries to delete that photo or replace it, an error is thrown.

## Future features to implement
* Live syncing of hunter page for teams.
* Player names inside teams.
* Customizable team names.  Just team numbers can get confusing.
* Host ability to delete and add teams to an already started hunt.
* Ended hunt screen displayed for hunters automatically when a host ends the hunt.
* Host account creation.
* Host login functionality, using either:
  * Google authentication
  * Email verification
* Collaboritve voting system for best scavenger hunt pictures.
* Third section on the host page which would allow the host to navigate back to an in-progress hunt.
